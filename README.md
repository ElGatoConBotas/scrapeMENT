More about this project

The band, that I am part of, got to play at Ment music festival this year and this way we got to meet many new people. Since we do not have a booking manager or anyone like that, we are eager to meet influential figures of the music industry and make our own network of contacts, that we might need in the future. Pro-ment database is a great addition to our contacts list as it contains a lot of foreign and local musicians, managers and venues.
